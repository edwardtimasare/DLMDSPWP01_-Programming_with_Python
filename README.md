# In this work, i am to use the test data to determine for each and every x-y pair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the four chosen ideal functions,  following these steps:

# Iterate over each x-y pair in the test data.

# For each x-y pair, calculate the deviation between the y value and the predicted y value for each of the four chosen ideal functions.

# Compare the deviation of each x-y pair to the largest deviation between the training dataset and the ideal function chosen for it. If the deviation does not exceed the largest deviation by more than factor sqrt(2), then the x-y pair can be assigned to the ideal function.

# Save the deviation and the ideal function to which the x-y pair is assigned.

# Visualize the data by plotting the x-y pairs, the ideal functions, and the deviation of the x-y pairs
